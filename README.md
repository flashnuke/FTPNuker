## Usage

Simply run `./FTPNuker.sh target_host user_name path_to_passlist.txt` </br>
The script sends simple cURL requests with the credentials, and scans the response for success login codes (`225, 226`).

### Internal Settings
You can modify the `cURL` timeout, target port and frequency of echoing inside the bash file.

## General Notes

* This script does not attempt [anonymous login](https://securityforeveryone.com/tools/anonymous-ftp-login-checker)
* This won't work on machines that implement protection against FTP bruteforcing
